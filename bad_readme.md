# Our super awesome research project

## Documentation
We can organise a Google Meet to explain the code, but I am busy until Friday

## Version
Uh it was updated last Wednesday I think?

## Collaboration
Our changes will break each other's code, so please don't edit lines 190-200 in `main.py` also don't touch the filtering scripts!

## Testing
It was working last time I used it...

## Installation
We're not quite sure ourselves, good luck!
